Project: The Home Run Network
Precision Driver Tracking & Geospatial Logistics
The Home Run Network is a full-stack logistics platform designed to bridge the gap between riders and drivers using advanced geospatial technology. By combining PostGIS for spatial data integrity and Google Maps API for real-time intelligence, the platform provides a seamless "home-to-destination" experience.

🚀 Key Features
Geospatial Processing: Automated translation of street addresses into GEOGRAPHY(POINT) coordinates using PostGIS.

Real-Time Admin Dashboard: A secure command center to monitor active driver locations and ride statuses via live polling.

Dynamic ETA: Integration with Google Distance Matrix API to provide live travel time estimates between drivers and riders.

Role-Based Security: Distinct user journeys for Admins, Drivers, and Riders, managed via Spring Security.

Exportable Reports: One-click JSON/CSV reporting for administrative audit and logistics history.
